You can try it, here is the GitHub Pages [link](https://nagyryt.github.io/blackjack/)

- There are 6 decks in a hand.
- Your starting chips are $2500.
- BlackJack pays 3 to 2.
- Dealer must stand on 17.
- If the dealer's first card is an ace you can take out insurance. Insurance is half your bet and pays 2 to 1.
- If the value of your first two cards are the same, you can split your cards.
