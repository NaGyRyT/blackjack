You can try it, here is the GitHub Pages [link](https://nagyryt.github.io/blackjack/)

- Default there are 6 decks in a hand, but you can set it between 1-8.
- Default starting chips are $2500, but you can set it between $100 - $5000.
- I store both values in the browser's Local Storage.
- BlackJack pays 3 to 2.
- Dealer must stand on 17.
- If the dealer's first card is an ace you can take out insurance. Insurance is half your bet and pays 2 to 1.
- If the value of your first two cards are the same, you can split your cards.
- Rules are from [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack).
